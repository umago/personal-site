# About:

Hi, my name is Lucas Alvares Gomes and I'm a software engineer at [Red
Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) where I currently work on [OVN (Open Virtual
Network)](http://www.openvswitch.org//support/dist-docs/ovn-architecture.7.html)
and related [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) projects.

In the past I worked on the Bare Metal Provisioning program (a.k.a Ironic)
within [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) as a core reviewer.

Anything posted in this site is my opinion, and in no way reflects the
policies or practices of my employer.
